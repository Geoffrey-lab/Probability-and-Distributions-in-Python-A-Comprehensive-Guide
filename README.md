# Probability and Distributions: A Comprehensive Guide

## Description
This repository contains a detailed Jupyter Notebook that provides an in-depth exploration of probability and various statistical distributions. The notebook is designed to help users understand and visualize key concepts in descriptive and inferential statistics using Python, Pandas, Numpy, and SciPy. The examples and visualizations included cover a wide range of topics, from basic descriptive statistics to complex probability distributions.

## Features
- **Descriptive Statistics**:
  - Calculation of basic descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.).
  - Visualization of statistical data using bar plots.
- **Inferential Statistics**:
  - Comparison of mean deforestation rates over different years.
  - Probability calculations using normal, binomial, Poisson, negative binomial, exponential, and uniform distributions.
- **Data Handling**:
  - Handling and analysis of various types of data (nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio).
  - Mapping ordinal data to numerical values for analysis.
- **Visualization**:
  - Bar plots for mean comparison.
  - Probability mass function (PMF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) plots for various distributions.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/probability-and-distributions.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```bash
   cd probability-and-distributions
   ```
3. Install the required packages:

```
Follow the notebook cells sequentially to explore the examples and visualizations.

## Examples
### Descriptive Statistics
- **Deforestation Rates**:
  - Calculation and visualization of deforestation rates in various regions.
  - Example:
    ```python
    descriptive_stats = df['Deforestation_rate_2020'].describe()
    print(descriptive_stats)
    ```

### Inferential Statistics
- **Mean Deforestation Rates**:
  - Comparison of mean deforestation rates between 2020 and 2021.
  - Example:
    ```python
    plt.bar(years, means, color=['blue', 'green'])
    plt.xlabel('Year')
    plt.ylabel('Mean Deforestation Rate (hectares)')
    plt.title('Mean Deforestation Rate Comparison: 2020 vs. 2021')
    plt.show()
    ```

### Probability Distributions
- **Normal Distribution**:
  - Calculation of probability for a range of values.
  - Example:
    ```python
    normal_prob(2, 5, mu, sigma)
    ```
- **Binomial Distribution**:
  - PMF and probability calculation.
  - Example:
    ```python
    prob_exactly_10 = binom.pmf(k, n, p)
    ```
